## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the source code into a new directory on your machine.
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and run:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/gmroue01/FactInZ-Memetic-Heuristic-Python-Numba.git](https://github.com/gmroue01/FactInZ-Memetic-Heuristic-Python-Numba.git)
cd FactInZ-Memetic-Heuristic-Python-Numba
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
It is highly recommended to use a **virtual environment**. This creates an isolated space for the project's dependecies, ensuring they don't conflict with other Python projects on your system.

- **For Windows**
  ```
  # Create the environment named 'venv'
  python -m venv venv

  # Activate the environment
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
